# 02023 Sharpen physics, python, and JupyterLite for Matt

After reading Sean Carroll's "The Biggest Ideas in the Universe" (and purchasing Thorne & Blandford's (TB) "Modern Classical Physics" (in hardback) and also never getting into MTW's Gravitation), I decided to work through TB then maybe MTW. TB is targetted to first year physics grad students. To make sure I'm still sharp, I thought I might work through my undergrad physics book quickly but thoroughly - to make it interesting, I'll work through it in a jupyter notebook. I found jupyterlite for ease in global access and got that installed in my github area fairly easily (I had to modify a few settings in github to get it to deploy, those were well documented.) I think I'll use Halladay & Resnick (HR, 3rd edition - the one I used in 1989 at Southwestern University).

## Further Information and Updates

JupyterLite documentation:

- How-to Guides: https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/index.html
- Reference: https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html

## Thoughts / Maintenance

It seems that files created within jupyterlite aren't copied out into the github hierarchy? Perhaps it takes some time to copy over / propagate?

I imagine I'll have to get LaTeX sorted here - hopefully that isn't too bad. And can I use emacs as the editor in github? browser based emacs so I'm not machine-dependent? Hmm. Another adventure. Looks like Math Jax 2 https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/configure/latex.html
